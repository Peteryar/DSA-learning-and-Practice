## Problem
> write a singly linked list

> implement the following functions
  - Add the new item to the list
  - remove the last item with a pop method on the list
  - remove the first item with shift method on the list

## Overview of Linked list datastructure
A linked list is a collection of Node with each node having information about the next Node

## Pseudo for Singly Linked List Interface

1. write a class call Node that takes in val as parameter
2. the constructor of the class should set two variables for each instance of the class
   - variable val set to the val passed to the class
   - variable next set to null
3. create another class call SinglyLinkedList
   create three variables for each instance of the class call
    - head set to null
    - tail set to null
    - length set to  0
